How High School Students Respond to Changes in College Admissions Policies.<br></strong><br><strong>Abstract</strong> <br><br>This paper asks whether admission policies generate high school students&#x27; behavioral responses. I show that high school students react to college admission policies that rank students within their high school by switching schools. First, using a difference-in-difference strategy, I find that switchers target high schools with lower average GPAs. Second, I present evidence that switchers significantly increase the probability of attending selective colleges. Finally, I develop and estimate a theoretical model to study the effects of alternative admission policies. Using the model, I find that the number of low-income students accepted in the top 10 colleges is increased by 5% under the current policy, but if students were not allowed to switch, the results would be 10%. The magnitude of the effect suggests that these strategic movers are among the only beneficiaries of the policy.<br><br>‍</div>

However, the extant literature suggests that precipitation has a significant impact on electoral outcomes. This paper investigates an understudied dimension of weather—sunshine. Using novel daily weather measurements from satellites, linked to county ­level U.S. Presidential electoral returns from 1948­2016, we document how sunshine affects the decision making of voters. We find that election­ day exposure to sunshine increases support for the Democratic party on average. Additionally, we show that— contrary to prior findings that do not control for sunshine—precipitation has no detectable impact on partisan support, but universally depresses turnout. To rationalize our results we propose a mechanism whereby sunshine modulates voter mood which causes a change in voter choice, while precipitation only impacts turnout through increasing the cost of voting. We then build a theoretical model, which features this mechanism, and generates additional tests that find support in the data. Our main result—that election day sunshine noticeably impacts voter choice—highlights the need to reduce the effect of election day shocks (e.g. by allowing early voting). Furthermore, our results regarding precipitation suggest that reducing costs to voting does not confer partisan benefits—a potentially policy relevant finding for the current vote by mail discussion.<br>‍<br>‍</div>

I examine the effects of a large-scale policy in Chile that mandated all institutions using the centralized system to incorporate a student’s high school specific criterion, intended to help students with high performance during high school from socioeconomically marginalized groups. After the policy was put in place, the representation of high school students from low-quality schools in the most selective universities increased by 5 percentage points. I exploit the adoption of the policy and the local school market structure to estimate the effects of the college admission criteria on the quality of the school attended by students. My estimates indicate that students in local markets with high scope for gains are two percentage points less likely to attend a high-quality public school. To study the effects of larger changes in the college admission process, I estimate a joint model of school choice and outcomes. I identify the parameters of the model using exogenous variation in schools’ thresholds in local market, and students pre-reform gains.<br>‍<br>‍<br></div>

We use a strategy that compares 12th-grade students in classrooms that received more high achieving students with those from the same schools but who were exposed to fewer or no high achieving students. Using both basic and nonlinear-in-means specifications, we show evidence of heterogeneous effects depending on the ability of the incumbent students.<br><br>‍<br></div>
